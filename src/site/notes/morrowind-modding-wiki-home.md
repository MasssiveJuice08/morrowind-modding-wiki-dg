## Tests

- [x] test push -- can I push a commit via git plugin?
	- Yes, commits can be pushed directly to the repo without the Digital Garden plugin, and the site rebuilds and adds the changes
- [x] does .gitignore work? (i.e., are plugins and themes ignored by the git plugin?)
- [ ] can I add an image manually and link it via wikilink?
	- No, it needs to be a Markdown link, like so: 
		- `![Patches_ESP-Replacer_1_Conflict.png](/img/user/Assets/Guides/Patches/Tutorial%20-%20Create%20an%20ESP%20Replacer%20Patch/Patches_ESP-Replacer_1_Conflict.png)`. 
	- Note that for it to render correctly, any spaces in the file path need to be replaced with `%20`
- [ ] can I add an image manually and link it via Markdown?
	- test link is `![PuzzleBoxOnly.png](/img/user/Assets/Home/PuzzleBoxOnly.png)`
