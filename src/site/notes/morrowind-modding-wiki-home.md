## Tests

- [x] test push -- can I push a commit via git plugin?
	- Yes, commits can be pushed directly to the repo without the Digital Garden plugin, and the site rebuilds and adds the changes
- [x] does .gitignore work? (i.e., are plugins and themes ignored by the git plugin?)
- [ ] can I add an image manually?
